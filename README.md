# WorldPublicLibrary
A Project to bring all those old pages into the life of digital.

Every culture is special and has lot to contribute to humanity. keeping this moral in mind, it so appears that in the world we have limited  languages in use. while there are many culture and region can give alot more.... 

Idea of Implementation:

Mobile Application -> To Capture image of all the book pages -> Use OCR (Optical Character recoginer) to convert scanned pages to digital pages -> publish the book on public domain -> use advance technology to convert local language to world language -> store in destributed open network so can truly be called  **World Public Library**
